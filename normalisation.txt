What is Normalization?

Normalization is the process of organizing your database to:

* **Remove redundancy (duplicate data)**
* **Ensure data integrity (accuracy and consistency)**

 Why is it Important?

Without normalization:

* You may store the same data multiple times (wastes space)
* Updates can cause inconsistencies
* Queries become harder to manage


 1NF (First Normal Form) – *Atomic Values Only*

**Rule**: Each column must have **atomic (indivisible)** values.
There should be **no multiple values** in a single cell.

####  Bad (Not in 1NF):

| Student | Subjects      |
| ------- | ------------- |
| Ravi    | Math, Physics |

> Problem: Subjects are not atomic.

####  Good (1NF):

| Student | Subject |
| ------- | ------- |
| Ravi    | Math    |
| Ravi    | Physics |


###  2NF (Second Normal Form) – *No Partial Dependency*

 **Rule**: Table must be in 1NF, and **every non-key column should depend on the whole primary key**.

Applies mainly when you have **composite primary keys** (more than one column).

####  Bad:

| StudentID | Subject | StudentName |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| 1         | Math    | Ravi        |

> `StudentName` only depends on `StudentID`, not the full key (`StudentID + Subject`).

####  Good (2NF):

Break into 2 tables:

* **Student Table**: `StudentID`, `StudentName`
* **Marks Table**: `StudentID`, `Subject`



###  3NF (Third Normal Form) – *No Transitive Dependency*

 **Rule**: Table must be in 2NF, and **no non-key column should depend on another non-key column**.

####  Bad:

| ID | Name | DeptID | DeptName |
| -- | ---- | ------ | -------- |

> `DeptName` depends on `DeptID`, not `ID`. This is a **transitive dependency**.

####  Good (3NF):

Split into:

* **Employee Table**: `ID`, `Name`, `DeptID`
* **Department Table**: `DeptID`, `DeptName`



##  Summary:

| Normal Form | Key Rule                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| 1NF         | Atomic values            |
| 2NF         | No partial dependency    |
| 3NF         | No transitive dependency |
