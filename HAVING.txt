HAVING : HAVING is like WHERE, but it is used after GROUP BY to filter grouped results.

SELECT student_id, AVG(score) AS avg_score FROM SCHOOLDETAILS.marks GROUP BY student_id HAVING avg_score > 90;

+------------+-----------+
| student_id | avg_score |
+------------+-----------+
|          1 |   97.6667 |
|          2 |   99.3333 |
