### **DBMS (Database Management System)**

* It is software used to **store, manage, and retrieve data**.
* Data is stored in **files, folders, or tables**, but **not always in a structured way**.
* Does **not support relationships** between data.
* Example: **File system, XML database, hierarchical DBMS.**

**Think of it like a basic cupboard** where you can store files, but theyâ€™re not linked or organized very efficiently.


### **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**

* It is a **type of DBMS** that stores data in **tables with rows and columns**.
* Supports **relationships between tables** using keys (like **primary key**, **foreign key**).
* Follows **rules of relational models** (like normalization).
* Example: **MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.**

**Think of it like a smart cupboard** where every file is well-organized in drawers, and everything is connected logically.
